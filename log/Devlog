Day 1:

Spent a lot of time getting the dependancies to all be compatible. Had to downgrade ghc version to 9.2.5 for repa
ffmpeg-light was a huge pain, turn out it only works with ffmpeg version 4.4 even though it doesn't say this anywhere
Found emoji dataset
figured out loading and saving images
converting between color spaces
loaded in emojis as grayscale and scaled so brightest pixel was 1.0
tint grayscale image with any rgb color
converted all emojis to grayscale stamps to be loaded and tinted on the fly


Day 2:

Worked on generating a stamp with transparency
premultiply alpha during tint to make pasting simpler
overlay stamp onto image with arbitrary translation rotation scale tint and alpha
  it takes each pixel on the background, transforms the coordinates into the stamp image space and then interpolate in the stamp to select a pixel


Day 3:

generate random stamp specs including stamp index
image difference abs(r1-r2)+abs(g1-g2)+abs(b1-b2)
